### About Me

My only formal programming instruction was a semester of Java in high school, so I'm always trying to learn best practices to improve my work. For better or worse, I often avoid using frameworks (for example, I will spend more time trying to achieve my goal in pure JavaScript rather than doing it much easier in jQuery) and have a tendency to rewrite a project from scratch if I am unhappy enough with it, rather than spending time modifying the existing code.

I started programming when I was as young as 11 years old creating simple but specialized programs in Visual Basic before focusing on web development two years later when I got the opportunity to rewrite and maintain the website for a local organization. Since then, I have been primarily maintaining my skills in PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Occasionally I do some minor batch, bash, and Python scripting as the need arises.
